# Evade - A Game Made for Gamedev.js 2023 with the Theme "Time"
Evade is a game that puts you in control of time itself. You must use your powers to survive wave after wave of enemies, gaining power-ups along the way to help you stay alive. The game is made entirely in shaders, with no assets whatsoever, creating a unique and immersive experience.

### Game Objective
The objective of Evade is simple: survive each wave for a certain amount of time. As the waves progress, they become increasingly difficult, with more enemies and shorter time limits. To help you survive, you can collect power-ups that grant you various abilities, such as slowing down time or increasing your speed.

### Controls
Evade is played entirely with the mouse. The controls are as follows:

Scroll - change volume

Left mouse click - use time control

Esc - Pause
